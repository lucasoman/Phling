# Phling

Enhancements to make PHP not quite as ghetto.


## Phling Contents

More modules are going to be added as the project expands, but so far, Phling has the following:


### Delegator/Delegate

Easy delegation in PHP. Transparent to calling code and trivial to implement in your own code. Relies on PHP's magic methods to resolve method and attribute names of delegates.


### Traits

Traits/Roles in PHP. See this [blog post](http://lucasoman.blogspot.com/2009/09/different-way-traits-in-php.html) to see a different project inspired by the same concepts.


## To Do

- add traits
- form delegate
